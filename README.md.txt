ToDo List CRUD API
This project is a RESTful API for managing a ToDo list, built with ASP.NET Core 8 Minimal APIs. It provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for ToDo items. The project includes Docker support and a Postman collection for easy testing.

Features
CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete ToDo items.
Minimal APIs: Built using ASP.NET Core 8 Minimal API architecture for simplicity and performance.
Docker Support: Dockerfile included for easy containerization and deployment.
Postman Collection: A Postman collection is available for API testing.
Technologies Used
ASP.NET Core 8: Web API development.
Entity Framework Core: ORM for database access (SQLite, SQL Server, or another database of choice).
Docker: Containerization support for deployment.
Postman: API testing and documentation.
Requirements
.NET SDK 8.0
Docker (if running the app inside a Docker container)
Postman (for testing the API)
Getting Started
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-api.git
cd todo-api
Running the Application Locally
Install .NET 8 SDK: Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed.

PUT	/todoitems/{id}	Update a ToDo item
DELETE	/todoitems/{id}	Delete a ToDo item
Using Postman for Testing
Import the provided Postman collection (postman-collection.json) into Postman.
Use the collection to test the API endpoints.
Database Configuration
This project uses Entity Framework Core for database access. By default, it uses an in-memory database, but you can configure a database like SQLite or SQL Server by modifying the appsettings.json file or the connection string in Program.cs.

Docker Environment Variables
You can modify the following environment variables in the Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml:

ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Set the ASP.NET Core environment (Development, Production, etc.).
DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING: Set the database connection string if using an external database.
Building and Running Tests
You can write unit tests for your APIs and run them using the .NET CLI.

bash
Copy code
dotnet test
